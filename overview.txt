                         CEYLONBOOKING PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

PROJECT NAME: CeylonBooking (formerly CeylonStay/LankaStay)
VERSION: 1.0.0
PLATFORM: React Native Mobile Application (Android & iOS)
REPOSITORY: Lavindu17/CeylonBooking

================================================================================
                              PROJECT DESCRIPTION
================================================================================

CeylonBooking is a native mobile application designed as a Sri Lanka-focused 
alternative to Airbnb, tailored specifically for local hosts and domestic 
travelers. The application addresses the unique needs of the Sri Lankan market 
by offering LKR-based pricing, a simplified booking experience, and hardware-
integrated mobile features designed for the local context.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE PROBLEM THIS PROJECT SOLVES:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Global platforms like Airbnb operate in USD, increasing costs for Sri Lankan 
  users through currency conversion
• Limited support for local payment habits and regional UX expectations
• Overly complex interfaces that don't cater to domestic travel needs
• Lack of localized features specific to Sri Lankan geography and culture

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE SOLUTION:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• LKR-based pricing for transparent, local currency transactions
• Simplified booking experience optimized for domestic travelers
• Hardware-integrated mobile features (shake-to-reset, geofencing)
• UI/UX designed specifically following Apple Human Interface Guidelines
• Real-time booking system with calendar-based availability

   • url: Text (Public URL)
   • order: Integer (Display order)
   • created_at: Timestamp

4. auth.users (Managed by Supabase Auth)
   • id: UUID
   • email: Text
   • raw_user_meta_data: JSON (display_name, avatar_url, etc.)

ROW-LEVEL SECURITY (RLS) POLICIES:

Listings:
  • SELECT: Everyone can read all listings (public marketplace)
  • INSERT: Users can only create listings with their own host_id
  • UPDATE: Users can only update their own listings
  • DELETE: Users can only delete their own listings

Bookings:
  • SELECT: Users can view their own bookings
  • SELECT: Hosts can view bookings for their listings
  • INSERT: Users can only create bookings with their own user_id
  • UPDATE: Hosts can update status of bookings for their listings

Listing Images:
  • SELECT: Public read access
  • INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE: Only the listing owner

STORAGE BUCKETS:
  • listing-images: Public bucket for property photos
  • avatars: Public bucket for user profile pictures

DATA FLOW:

1. User Sign-up/Sign-in:
   User → Supabase Auth → JWT Token → Stored in AsyncStorage
   → AuthContext updates → App navigates to Home

2. Browse Listings:
   Home Screen → Supabase Query (SELECT * FROM listings) 
   → Real-time subscription → Display in grid

3. Search/Filter:
   User inputs → Client-side filtering or Supabase query with WHERE clauses
   → Update displayed results

4. Create Listing:
   Host inputs data → ListingCreationContext stores state
   → Upload images to Storage → Get public URLs
   → INSERT into listings table → Redirect to success screen

5. Booking Creation:
   Guest selects dates → Calculate total price
   → INSERT into bookings (status: pending)
   → Display confirmation

6. Booking Approval:
   Host views request → UPDATE bookings SET status = 'confirmed'
   → Real-time update to guest's booking list

QUERY OPTIMIZATION:
  ✓ Indexed foreign keys (host_id, listing_id, user_id)
  ✓ Composite queries with joins for efficiency
  ✓ Limit/offset for pagination (future scalability)
  ✓ Real-time subscriptions only where needed

DATA RELATIONSHIPS:
  users (1) ←→ (Many) listings (One host owns many listings)
  users (1) ←→ (Many) bookings (One user makes many bookings)
  listings (1) ←→ (Many) bookings (One listing has many bookings)
  listings (1) ←→ (Many) listing_images (One listing has many images)

================================================================================
                        PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED & SOLUTIONS
================================================================================

1. BABEL PLUGIN CONFIGURATION ERROR
   Problem: `[BABEL] .plugins is not a valid Plugin property` error during 
            Android bundling
   Solution: Corrected babel.config.js to properly configure NativeWind plugin
            with valid Babel configuration syntax

2. IMAGE UPLOAD RLS POLICY VIOLATIONS
   Problem: "new row violates row-level security policy for table 'listings'"
            when trying to upload images during listing creation
   Solution: Created and applied proper RLS policies for listing_images table
            and listing-images storage bucket, ensuring authenticated users
            can upload images for their own listings

3. GOOGLE SIGN-IN CONFIGURATION
   Problem: Google OAuth flow required complex Google Cloud Console setup
   Solution: Created comprehensive step-by-step guide for configuring OAuth
            consent screen, credentials, and Supabase integration

4. IMAGE LOADING FROM APPWRITE → SUPABASE MIGRATION
   Problem: "Route not found" errors when transitioning from Appwrite to 
            Supabase Storage
   Solution: Implemented manual URL construction for Supabase Storage with
            proper bucket paths and public URL generation

5. TYPESCRIPT TYPE ERRORS WITH REACT 19
   Problem: Type conflicts between React 19 and various dependencies
   Solution: Configured TypeScript with proper type declarations and updated
            @types/react to compatible version

6. AUTHENTICATION FLOW BREAKING
   Problem: App stuck on sign-in screen, navigation not working after login
   Solution: Fixed AuthContext to properly detect session state and updated
            root _layout.tsx to correctly navigate based on auth status

7. EXPO START TYPESCRIPT ERROR
   Problem: `TypeError [ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION]` with .ts files
   Solution: Configured proper Babel and Metro bundler settings for TypeScript
            and expo-modules-core compatibility

8. LISTING DATA NOT SHOWING HOST INFORMATION
   Problem: Fake/hardcoded ratings shown instead of actual host data
   Solution: Modified ListingCard component to fetch and display real host
            information from database joins with auth.users table

9. BOOKING MODAL UX ISSUES
   Problem: Users confused between "Book Now" and "Request Booking" buttons,
            modal not visually distinct from background
   Solution: Enhanced modal with prominent overlay, tap-to-close functionality,
            and clearer visual separation

10. SIGN-IN SCREEN POOR UX
    Problem: Basic, unappealing sign-in layout
    Solution: Redesigned to 45% hero image layout with "Continue with Email"
             and "Continue with Google" options, plus slide-up email/password
             form

11. DATABASE OVERLAP PREVENTION
    Problem: Need to prevent booking date overlaps (e.g., Dec 22 booked means
             Dec 20-23 should be blocked)
    Solution: Implemented calendar logic that disables any date range that
             intersects with existing bookings

12. LOCATION MAPPING FOR LISTINGS
    Problem: Hosts needed easy way to select listing location
    Solution: Integrated Google Maps with "Get Current Location" and manual
             pin placement options in listing creation wizard

13. PERFORMANCE WITH MULTIPLE IMAGE UPLOADS
    Problem: Slow image uploads during listing creation
    Solution: Implemented base64-arraybuffer encoding and optimized Supabase
             Storage upload with proper error handling

14. GEOFENCING BATTERY DRAIN
    Problem: Continuous background location monitoring drains battery
    Solution: Implemented efficient geofencing with significant location change
             monitoring instead of continuous updates

15. STATE MANAGEMENT ACROSS WIZARD STEPS
    Problem: Losing form data when navigating between listing creation steps
    Solution: Created ListingCreationContext using React Context API to persist
             state across all wizard screens
